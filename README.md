# Pokedex
Pokedex is a simple application that displays information about Pokemon and their descriptions. The information is obtained from the Pokemon API.
The application is built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
I have tried to give the application a Pokemon-like theme and design. The design and layout of the application are my responsibility.
